# Welcome to the Alliance Business Suite Documentation!

Aiming to help organizations reach beyond expectations, the Alliance Business Suite is designed to augment businesses across industries worldwide through a low-code, and fully customizable business development platform.

At a very high level, the Alliance Business Suite is a set of powerful, extensible, multi-tenant applications built to enable businesses to jumpstart their digitalization process through powerful business applications built to cover the core processes of any given business.

The Alliance Business Suite provides customers with a Full-Stack, Low-Code, Modular, and Multi-Tenant Business Application Framework built on top of the [Alliance Business Platform](https://absuite.net/Suite/Platform). 

The Alliance Business Suite relies on [five major components](/Components.md) designed to separate different functionalities into layers; these components are:

- ## [Alliance Core Libraries](/Components/Alliance-Core-Libraries.md)

The Alliance Core Libraries contain the core abstractions and default implementations required by the Alliance Business Model and dependent components. It is also the external dependency source for the entire Alliance Business Suite, which means that external dependencies, which are dependencies outside the `FenixAlliance.*` namespace, are referenced by the `FenixAlliance.ACL.Deps` Package, which is the base ACL Package and, therefore, it could be referred to as the Core Package.

For more information on the dependency tree, design overview, and external dependencies, please refer to [Advanced Topics](/Advanced.md).

- ## [Alliance Business Model](/Components/Alliance-Business-Model.md)

The Alliance Business Model is a declarative specification and definition of standard entities that represent commonly used concepts and activities across business and productivity applications and is being extended to observational and analytical data as well. ABM provides well-defined, modular, and extensible business entities such as Accounts, Business Units, cases, Contact, Leads, Opportunity, and Items (Products/Services) and interactions with vendors, workers, and customers, such as activities and service level agreements. that serve as the dynamic data layer for the entire Alliance Business Suite.

Anyone can build on and extend ABM definitions to capture additional business-specific scenarios.


- ## [Alliance Passport Service](/Components/Alliance-Passport-Service.md)

The Alliance Passport Service enables developers and non-developers alike 
The Alliance Passport Service is an Authentication/Authorization Engine designed to enable customers to easily configure and manage business identity scenarios by assigning (or connecting) a digital identity to their contacts, whether they are customers, employees, partners, guests, and more. 

It also provides common features for managing authentication, authorization, data protection, HTTPS enforcement, app secrets, XSRF/CSRF prevention, and CORS management. These security features allow you to build robust, yet secure Alliance Business Suite apps.

- ## [Alliance Business Platform](Components/Alliance-Business-Platform.md)

The Alliance Business Platform is a Modular API Framework. It leverages .NET 5.0 with the best of REST, SignalR, GraphQl y gRPCto transact with the Alliance Business Model Schema (AMB). The Alliance Business Platform is an open-source and cross-platform framework for integrating next-generation functionalities into your applications. It allows you to build spectacular single-page apps using .NET and C# with or without JavaScript. ABP apps can connect and transact to the data layer (The Alliance Business Modal Schema) using any language through standard requests through the various GrPC, HTTP, and GraphQL Endpoints. 

To capture additional business-specific scenarios, you can easily build on and extend The Alliance Business Platform through ASP.NET + Angular / React (And pretty much any Web Stack Framework).

- ## [Alliance Business Studio](/Components/Alliance-Business-Studio.md)

The Alliance Business Studio is the Graphical Administration Engine for the Alliance Business Suite. It allows users to manage their implementations, transact data through the Alliance Business Platform, generate and consume views, and reports, customize and extend the system, and much more.

You can build on top of, and extend The Alliance Business Studio to capture additional business-specific scenarios.

## How to build applications on top of the Alliance Business Suite?

Client and server code are written in C#, allowing users to extend the product with their code through Module libraries. It builds upon next-generation technologies such as Blazor, SignalR, Razor Pages, and MVC through .NET, an open-source and cross-platform framework for building web-mobile apps using C#, with or without the use of JavaScript.

The power of the Alliance Business Suite can be leveraged from small personal blogs, eCommerce platforms, and professional portfolios to the infrastructure of large corporations.

### User Guide
- [Documentation](https://docs.absuite.net)
- [Roadmap](https://dev.azure.com/fenixalliance/ABS.Docs/_workitems/recentlyupdated)

# Getting Started

- Install **[.NET 6 SDK (v6.0.*)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)**.

## For Business Use.

- Download or Clone the latest Alliance Business Suite release. Decompress the downloaded `.zip` on a folder on your PC, navigate to that folder and execute the `FenixAlliance.ABS.Web.exe` file. 

A console window will pop up, providing information about the initialization process. Open your server on the provided URL, go through the installation wizard, and start using the Alliance Business Suite. For more information about hosting your Alliance Business Suite instance, please refer to [Hosting your Alliance Business Suite.](/Fundamentals/Hosting.md)

## For Developer Users

- Install the latest edition (v16.8 or higher) of [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) (Community, Professional, or Enterprise Editions) with the **ASP.NET and web development** workload enabled. Alliance Business Suite works with ALL editions of Visual Studio from Community to Enterprise. If you do not have a SQL Server installation available already and you wish to use LocalDB for development, you must also install the **.NET desktop development workload**.  

- Download a release or Clone the ABS. Portal repository to your local system using Git. Open the **FenixAlliance.ABS.Portal.sln** solution file and Build the solution. Make sure you specify FenixAlliance.ABS.Portal as the Startup Project and then Run the application.


**Installing an official release:**

- A detailed set of instructions for installing Alliance Business Suite on IIS is located here: [Installing Alliance Business Suite on IIS](https://absuite.net/blog/installing-abs-on-iis)
- Instructions for upgrading Alliance Business Suite are located here: [Upgrading Alliance Business Suite ](https://absuite.net/blog/upgrading-abs)

**Additional Instructions**

- If you have already installed a previous version of Alliance Business Suite and you wish to do a clean database install, simply point the DefaultConnection value in the ABS Portal Settings Manager to a fresh database record. This will trigger a re-install when you run the application which will execute the database installation scripts.
   
- Every ABS Repo ignores appsettings.json by default, so as long as you don't delete the directive from .gitignore, you're cleared to submit a pull request. 

**Video Series**

- If you are getting started with Alliance Business Suite, a [series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGYfOT42OgSZdmYctCWeiRkPfGVQbCRWM) are available that explain how to install the product, interact with the user interface, and develop custom modules.

## Documentation
There is a separate [Documentation repository](https://dev.azure.com/fenixalliance/ABS.Docs), which contains various types of documentation for the Alliance Business Suite, including the C# API documentation for every class on every library. The contents of the repository are available at [https://docs.absuite.net](https://docs.absuite.net) as interactive documentation.

* Rename previously published attributes or entities
* Remove previously published attributes
